# NAFlora-1M mini

This folder provides information on of how NAFlora-1M mini dataset was created. We provide full anatomy of the training and validation set, sampling from the training data. Since the testing data was sampled from a hold-out set, it is kept seperate for future validation purposes. Validation set would work sufficiently to benchmark the data.
